disambig
=============

Fork of the [Patent Network Disambiguation](https://github.com/patentnetwork/CPP_Disambiguation) project from Lee Fleming and co-authors. This version is customized to the [PATSTAT](http://www.epo.org/searching/subscription/raw/product-14-24.html) global patent database. Notable changes include use of legal identifiers for companies, and collapse of first/middle/last names onto a single name field to reflect lack of resolution inside PATSTAT itself.
